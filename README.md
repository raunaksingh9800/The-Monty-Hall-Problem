# Monty Hall Problem Simulation

 Unveiling the Counterintuitive 2/3 Probability

 Explore the fascinating Monty Hall Problem through this C++ simulation!

 ## Description

 This repository contains a C++ program that simulates the Monty Hall Problem, a famous probability puzzle that often challenges intuition. It demonstrates through multiple trials that switching doors after the host reveals a goat has a 2/3 probability of winning the car, contrary to the initial 50/50 assumption.

 ## Features

Clear and concise C++ code with comments for easy understanding.
User-friendly interface to specify the number of trials.
Detailed output showing the results of each trial and the overall win rates for both staying and switching strategies.
Visual demonstration (if applicable) with a simple graphic to illustrate the problem and its solution.
 ## Usage

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Compile the C++ program using a C++ compiler.
Run the executable, providing the desired number of trials as input.
Observe the results and explore the counter-intuitive nature of probability!
 ## Key Insights

The Monty Hall Problem highlights how additional information can significantly alter probabilities.
Switching doors is the optimal strategy, even though it might seem counterintuitive at first.
Simulations provide a powerful tool for understanding and visualizing probability concepts.
 ## Further Exploration

Experiment with different numbers of trials to see how the results converge towards the 2/3 probability.
Extend the program to explore variations of the Monty Hall Problem.
Research the psychological factors that contribute to the counterintuitive nature of this problem.
